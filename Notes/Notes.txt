TODO:
	- transparency
		. try frosted ice/glass shader
	- height map
		. (0..255) then map(r, 0, 255, minHeight, maxHeight)
		. canvas to get pixel, https://stackoverflow.com/a/8751659
		. and delete the canvas after

		. explore on another day
			. use shadershop to generate own height map

	- mouse picking
		. glMatrix.vec4.transformMat4( receivingVec, vecToTransform, mat4ToTransformWith )

	- water
		. try rendering the depth buffer
		  (if no colors, make it grayscale)
		. "Instead of disabling the clip plane, you can simply set the vector to 0,0,0,0"
		. "be sure that your refraction texture has the same resolution than your display ! The reflection texture size doesn't matter, you can reduce it"
		. "make deeper water look murky then can add" :
		  refractColour = mix(refractColour, murkyWaterColour, clamp(waterDepth/60.0, 0.0, 1.0));

	- particles
		. data.gui for particle customization?
			https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage
		. recreate KA projects
		. recreate ultima

	- multiple render targets
		. glow map moonstone

	- geometry shader
		. paraphrased "calculate triangle normal in geometry shader instead of
		  having duplicate vertices in VAO (to store precomputed face normals)"

	- cube map reflections
		. what does it look like with just refraction (no reflection)?

	- animation
		. find well supported js library for importing collada?
		  or use bespoke (more control) like tuts?



	- How does Three.js allow dynamic light/object adding (re shaders)?

	- when something worth showing, take video cause changing API etc.
		. maybe https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js/

	- Implement window resizing support as per WebGLFund


	- Generate primitives (greggman)
		. generate object given params
			. ex. box (incl. cube), sphere, ellipse

	- GUI
		. (greggman)
			. main.html can have '<div id="uiContainer"><div id="ui"></div></div>'
			  then just use 'createChild'
		. chrome dat.gui
			. whatever has needed features...


	- Physics (BennyBox)
		. sphere-sphere collision
			. when rendering
			    - change color to show intersection
			    - allow object to be draggable/movable
		
		. axis aligned bounding box collision
			. box-box
		
		. plane collision
			. plane-sphere

	- Raycasting 
		. (http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/raycasting.html)
		. ray-plane
		. ray-sphere
		. ray-box(aabb)
		. ray-triangle(barycentric)
